## Employee database analysis for retiring employees using SQL and pgAdmin

## Overview

- salaries.csv
- titles.csv

### Software:

### Results

Primary keys are an important part of database design. When a database is being created, each table added must include a primary key in the architecture. Primary keys serve as a link between these tables.

- The tables includes employee number, first name, last name, title, from-date and to-date.
